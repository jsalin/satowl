SatOwl - A satellite tracking and antenna targetting system
Copyright (C) 2016 Jussi Salin under GPLv3 license.

Uses SGP4 library available at: https://www.danrw.com/sgp4/
The library is statically linked and has Apache license.

The system consists of a Arduino firmware and a PC program (that could
be later ported for smart phones.)

The Arduino part is used for reading tilt
and magnetometer sensors on an antenna. It also controls two servo
motors (azimuth and elevation) that change the direction of the antenna.

The PC program is used for calculating movements to target a satellite
with the antenna and it connects to Arduino over USB or Bluetooth serial
port. SGP4 algorithm is used to calculate position of a satellite based
on standard KEPS format data. You need to also give your own location
(longtitude, latitude and height from sea level.) Integrated GPS could
be used for that on future Android version. Coordinates don't have to
be more exact than a city area, so you can use attached script to get
your coordinate from Google's web service.

Currently the KEPS and own location data is hard coded.
